What is a Pull Request?

Not a git command.
- PR's are not actually part of GIT.
- Just as Hallmark created Valentines day, GitHub completely invented the Pull Request.
- PR's are just a diff between two branches, (usually a feature branch, and master) where people can leave comments.
- PR's can be a testing gate for CI systems (codeship, travis, jenkins, et cetera.)

What does `git pull` actually do?
- fetch, and merge
- fetch = update your tracking branches
- merge = 



You are saying: "I want YOU to pull from MY branch"
- You have a new feature
- You have a bugfix/repair
- You have refactored something
